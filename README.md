# AppTrackr
AppTrackr is a job application tracking tool built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) that helps users manage and organize their job search process efficiently. The app uses a Kanban board interface to track the progress of job applications through various stages of the job hunt, such as:

- Wishlist: Jobs you are interested in applying to.
- Applied: Jobs you've submitted applications to.
- Interview: Jobs where you've been called for an interview.
- Offer: Jobs where you've received an offer.
- Declined: Jobs that did not result in an offer or were declined.

# Features

- User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using JWT-based authentication.
- Dynamic Job Board: Drag-and-drop functionality allows users to move job applications between stages, with real-time updates.
- Detailed Application Tracking: Each job card contains vital information, including:

  - Company Name
  - Job Title
  - Job Description
  - Application Status
  - Notes
  - Created At & Updated At timestamps

- Notes Section: Users can add notes specific to each job application to track interview details, follow-up dates, and other important information.
